The purpose of this project is to Prove a relationship between the color of a car vs the price of a car. Ultimately I will be trying to prove that RED colored cars on Average are purchased at a higher price point that other cars of the same type.
How do we accomplish this?
I found a database of several Hundered Toyota Carollas and there purchase points, the data base ranges over a several year span and includes several different colors of the Toyota Carolla over several different models of the car. 
I grouped the cars by color and found the average price per color, i then displayed the results in a bar graph to make it more pleasing to the eye.
In conclusion we find that RED colored cars are actually not the most expensive on average, they are actually middle of the pack.
WE however found that Yellow cars tend to be the more expensive color.

How to improve?
I could of found a database that also includes milage, this would allow me to not only group by color but by mileage to see if there is any correlation. Also i could of grouped them by age to see if there was perhaphs a time period where different colors are more expensive.
